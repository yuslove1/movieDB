# Movie Database Application

This project is my capstone project for the ALX Frontend Development course. It's a movie database web application built with React and tailwind that allows users to search for movies and view detailed information about them.


## Features

* **Search Functionality:** Search for movies by title.
* **Detailed Movie Information:** View details such as plot summaries, cast, ratings (e.g., IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes), and genres.
* **Responsive Design:**  Adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
* **Error Handling:** Handles network errors, invalid API responses, and no search results gracefully.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Clean and intuitive UI for a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used

* **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **Tailwind CSS:**  For styling and responsive design.
* **Axios:** For making API requests.
* **React Router:** For navigation between pages.
* **TMDb API:**  For fetching movie data.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yuslove1/movie-database-app.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    cd movie-database-app

3. Install dependencies:
    npm install
4. Obtain an API key from TMDb API

5. Create a .env file in the root directory and add your API key:
    REACT_APP_OMDB_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

6 Start the development server:
    npm start

## API Usage
This application uses the TMDb API to fetch movie data. You'll need to obtain an API key to use the API. The API key is stored in a .env file.

## Future Improvements
* Implement more advanced search filtering options (e.g., by year, genre, actors).
* Add user authentication and the ability to save favorite movies.
* Integrate with other movie APIs to provide a wider range of data.
* Improve the UI/UX with animations and transitions.
